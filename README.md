 Dynamic Encryptor key changer for security


## 1.Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/prasannan-robots/Dynamic_command.git
```

## How it works
First the encrpyted data contains a encrypted string (by current key)
<br>
### 'current key encrypted by previous key (for security), new key encrypted by previous key (for sharing the new key), Data encrypted by new key'
<br>
i.e current key,new key, data
<br>
And decrypted by the same way and stored
